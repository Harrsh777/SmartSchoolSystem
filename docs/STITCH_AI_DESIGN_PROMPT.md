## 1. Landing page

Design a mobile app **landing screen** for a School ERP product. It should feel professional and education-focused. Include: a clear hero headline (e.g. “Manage your school in one place”), a short value proposition, and primary CTAs: “Login” and “Request demo.” Use a clean layout with one main illustration or hero image. Style: modern, trustworthy, not playful. Target: school admins and educators.

## 2. Login page

Design a **login screen** for a School ERP mobile app. Single screen with: school code field, user ID field (staff ID or admission number depending on role), password field, “Login” button, and a subtle link “Forgot password?” Keep it minimal and accessible. Use a simple logo area at the top. Style: clean, secure, professional. No clutter.

## 3. Signup page

Design a **signup screen** for schools to register for the School ERP. Form fields: school name, contact name, email, phone, and “Submit” button. Add a short line like “Already have an account? Login.” Layout: single column, clear hierarchy. Style: professional, trustworthy, easy to scan.

## 4. Color scheme and branding

Suggest a **color scheme and branding** for a School ERP mobile app used by: (1) school admins, (2) teachers, (3) students, (4) accountants. Requirements: one primary brand color that works for all roles; distinct but harmonious accent colors or badges per role (e.g. admin = blue, teacher = green, student = orange, accountant = purple). Include neutral backgrounds and text colors for readability. Style: professional, inclusive, not childish. Prefer a light default theme with optional dark mode.

## 5. Student dashboard

Design a **student dashboard** home screen for a School ERP app. Include: welcome line with student name, 2–3 summary cards (e.g. attendance %, academic index, upcoming exams), a “My class” / timetable shortcut, a “Recent communication” list (notices), and a bottom tab or drawer for: Academics, Fees & transport, Requests, Communication, Account. Style: clear, calm, easy for students to understand. Use cards and list rows; avoid dense tables.

## 6. Staff / teacher dashboard

Design a **teacher dashboard** home screen for a School ERP app. Include: welcome with teacher name, “My class” / timetable shortcut, “My tasks” (todo list), daily agenda or today’s periods, quick links to: Attendance, Marks entry, Examinations, Students, Leave, Communication. Use a sidebar or bottom nav for: Home, Attendance, Examinations, Students, Leave, Settings. Style: efficient, professional, information-dense but organized.

---

## 7. Admin dashboard

Design a **school admin dashboard** home screen for a School ERP app. Include: school name in header, 4–6 summary cards (e.g. total students, staff, fees collected, pending leave, upcoming exams), and a menu/list for main modules: Students, Staff, Classes, Timetable, Examinations, Marks, Fees, Leave, Communication, Reports, Settings. Style: authoritative, clear hierarchy, suitable for desktop or tablet as well as phone. Use a collapsible sidebar or hamburger menu for navigation.

## 8. UI/UX principles (all screens)

Apply these **UI/UX principles** across the app: (1) One primary action per screen where possible. (2) Clear section headings and card titles. (3) Consistent spacing and touch targets (min 44pt). (4) Loading and empty states for every list. (5) Error messages that suggest what to do next. (6) Role-appropriate density: admin can be denser; student screens simpler and more visual. (7) Use the same component set (buttons, inputs, cards) across student, staff, and admin for consistency.

You can combine these (e.g. “Landing + Login + color scheme”) or use them one-by-one in Stitch.ai to get screen mockups and style guides.
